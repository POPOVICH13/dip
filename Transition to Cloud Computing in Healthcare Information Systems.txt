 1.  Introduction 

 The  focus  of  this  thesis  is to  explore  the  current  state  of  the  art  of  applications  of  cloud 

 computing  in the  healthcare  information technology  industry. The  goal  is  
                                                                                        to  provide guidelines 

 for  people  who  are  trying  to  bring  cloud  computing  into  healthcare   information  systems, 

 through  the  use   of  a framework   of  tools  and   processes  to  overcome  both  technical  and 

 business challenges. 

 The  healthcare  industry  has  been  slow  in adopting  the  cloud  computing  model  compared  to 

 some  other  industries. According  to  the  CDW  2011  Cloud  Computing  Tracking  Poll,  only thirty 

 percent  of organizations  in  healthcare  are  implementing or  maintaining cloud computing  based 

 systems  (CDW   LLC,   2011).  Among  those   healthcare  organizations  who   have  adopted  cloud 

 computing,  39%  of  them   are  using  Live   Meeting,  24%  are   using  Gmail,  and   18%  are  using 

 Google  Docs.  Therefore  so  far  the  dominant  cloud  services  adopted  in   healthcare  are  still 

 commodity  applications,  not  yet  the  core  applications  with  healthcare  specialties  or  other 

cloud-based  services,  like storage. 

 During the  course  of the  research  for this thesis,  I reviewed  the  latest  literature,  interviewed  a 

number      of  professionals,    researchers,     and   leaders   in   cloud   computing   and      healthcare 

information  technology  fields,  and  used  various  analytical tools  learned  in  the  System  Design 

and  Management  program,  such  as system  analysis and  business  dynamics, to fully  understand 

the  dynamics  and  challenges  in  the  transformation  from  conventional  computing  into  cloud 

computing in  healthcare  industry. 

A series  of  issues,  including  but  not  limited  to  security  and  privacy,  government  policies  and 

regulations, and  data  handling  are the  major  roadblocks for  a rapid cloud  computing  adoption. 

There  are  much  literature  describing the existence  of these  issues, their  consequences, and  the 

urgency  of  solving  these   issues.      But  few   have   addressed   the   root  causes   and      provided 

pragmatic  solutions.  This  thesis  is an  attempt  to  reconcile  the  major  issues  that  have  been 

discovered  in  literature  and  in  discussions  with  people  in the  field,  and  then  provide  practical 

guidelines on  overcoming these  roadblocks  using analytical tools.  Even though  no one  absolute 

solution works  for  all  scenarios,  at  least  we  hope  to  reveal  all  the  hidden  blocks and  spell  out

the  principles, so  that  the  readers  can  get  ahead  of the  curve when  facing  the transformation. 

Willingly  or  unwillingly,  people  in the  field  have  to  stand  up  to  the  transformation   as   it  is 

coming  at their way. 

To  make this  thesis  self-sufficient for  all  levels  of  readers,  it  will  start with  some  background 

information  on   cloud   computing  and   healthcare   information   systems,   as  well   as                 related 

regulations.  Healthcare  is a huge  industry and  information technology  plays an  important  role 

with  many  perspectives.  In the  context  of this thesis,  the  discussions  will  be  centered  on  the 

domain  specific  applications,  e.g.  the  Electronic  Healthcare  Record  (EHR)            information  systems, 

rather than  the  commodity  application  systems  (e.g.  Emails,  Calendars, Web  Meetings,  Offices, 

etc.). 

Then  it will  discuss  in  depth  the  state  of the  art  cloud  services  and  applications  in healthcare 

domain   and  the  known  and   unknown  issues  with  these  services  and  applications,  in  both 

technical and  business arenas. 

 Following  that,  the  thesis   will   analyze   the   issues   using   systems   and   business   analytical 

 instruments  to  fully  understand  the  issues  from  different  angles,  as  well  as  the  forces  and 

 interactions with other critical factors  in the  business  ecosystem. 

 Finally,  based  on  the  facts  and  analysis,  it will  propose  a framework  of a set  of  process  steps 

 and  characteristics  that  can   be  applied  at  different  stages  during  the  transformation  from 

 conventional  computing to cloud  computing. A case study on  cloud  based  EHR  adoption will  be 

 used to demonstrate the application  of the  proposed framework.

2.   Background  Information 

    2.1     Cloud Computing 

    Cloud   computing    has  been   coined   as  an  umbrella   term   to  describe   a  category   of 

    sophisticated on-demand  computing services  initially offered  by commercial  providers, such 

    as  Amazon,   Google,   and   Microsoft   (Rajkumar  Buyya,   2011).   The  key  concept  of  Cloud 

    Computing  is to  deliver computing resources  through  a global  network when and  where the 

    customer   requests.  The   "cloud"   in  the  term  is  a  metaphor  for  computing   resources 

    (hardware and  software) that companies  and  users access without the  need  to  know exactly 

    where  that  hardware  and  software  is  
                                             physically located.  It  is also  used as  a graphical symbol 

    for  the   Internet   in   diagrams  of  computer   networks   to  depict  the  varied  technology 

    infrastructures the cloud  conceals (Hugos  & Hulitzky, 2011). 

    The  technology  advancement   in  grid   computing  and  virtualization  with  efficient  cluster 

    management  has  made  it  possible for  cloud  computing  to  provide  large  scale  computing 

    services  to  massive  user  bases.  Cafaro  and  Aloisio  (Cafaro  & Aloisio,  2011)  gave  a clear 

    explanation  on  the  relationships  among  grids,  clouds  and  virtualization.  In short,  grids 

    provide the  distributed  infrastructure  and  promise to deliver computing  power  on  demand, 

    clouds  provide  computing  services,  business  applications  and  functions  through  grid,  and 

   virtualization  decouples   cloud   services  from   physical   locations   by   hiding  the   physical 

    characteristics  of computing  resources.  They  work  together to  achieve dynamic  resizing  of 

   the  infrastructure,   balance  of  workload,   server  consolidation,  and  on-demand   resource 

    provision. 

    Cloud   computing  is a type  of  network  computing.  Network  computing   is not  new,  but 

    compared  to the  conventional  network systems, cloud  computing  is unique in  the following 

    areas. 

   Design principles  &  
                           architecture 

    Many cloud  service  providers evolved from  traditional  IT  
                                                                 companies. Traditional  IT  
                                                                                             products 

    (software,   hardware,   or   integrated   systems)   are  typically  designed   to   meet   specific

requirements   in  the  traditional  network  environment.   Even  though  many  traditional   IT 

products  also  support  distributed  computing,  cloud  based  products  (software,  platform,  or 

infrastructure)  emphasize  the  use  of  grid  computing  and  virtualization  technologies,  and 

face  a different set of challenges  in terms  of scalability, security, and flexibility. For  example, 

in  cloud  computing,  user  data  is  usually  saved   in  data   centers  that  are   independently 

located,  and  are  shared  by  many  users.  The  cloud  service  provider  may  save  storage  by 

allowing different  users  access  to the same  disk  drives,  but  in  turn  they  have  to  make sure 

users are  not allowed to access other  user's data  without  permission. 

 For  cloud  service  users,  taking Software  as  a Service  (SaaS)  applications as  an  example, the 

design  and  development  of the  application  is usually  done  in  a web  environment  that  is 

provided  by  the  cloud  hosting  company.  Design  is generally  limited  by the  capabilities of 

                                       traditional  Software  Development  Environment  (SDE)   usually 
low-level  programming that  a  

has,  but instead,  cloud-based  SaaS  provides  pre-defined  high-level  components  or  objects 

to  speed  up  the  development.  An  example  is the  development  of customized  Customer 

 Relation  Management  (CRM)  applications  on  SalesForce.com  or  Force.com.  Because  of the 

widely expanded  range of applications sharing on  the same  cloud, the  design  principles and 

architecture  of the cloud varies  significantly from traditional  software applications. 

Security  & data storage considerations 

                                                                       dynamic  scalability, or the  ability to 
 One  of the  core  design  principles of cloud  computing  is  

 provision  and  decommission  servers  or  services  on  demand.  To  the  cloud  user,  dynamic 

 scalability  can  be  achieved  by  using  third-party  data  storage  or  web  service  clouds  on  a 

 subscription  basis.  However,  doing  that  requires  them  to  store  data  in  the  cloud.  Because 

 the data  is physically stored  at  an  unknown  location,  extra  caution  is needed  to ensure  the 

 security and  reliability of the data storage. 

 Sometimes       regulations  and   government   policies  require   different  level   of  security  on 

 different data sets.  For  example,  in the  healthcare  industry, the HIPAA  Security  Rule  posed  a 

 bigger  challenge  to  safeguarding  protected  healthcare  information.  Meeting  the  security 

 and  privacy  rules is critical to a successful  cloud  computing system.

 Service  delivery  & deployment  methods 

 Whether  the  cloud is provided  as  an  internal corporate  resource (private cloud), as  a service 

 hosted  by  a third-party  (public cloud),  or as  a hybrid  of these  two  models,  the traditional 

 software     package  installations  through   CD         or  other  mediums,   are   changed  to  instant 

 subscription  and  pay as you go.  Most cloud  services are  delivered  through web  browsers,  or 

 in  some  cases  a  
                     thin-client with  very simple  functions to serve  as the  user interface -  which 

 is  
    also  called  "Ubiquitous  Network Access"  -  services  are  made  available over the  network 

 using  standard  mechanisms  which  support  a wide  range  of client  devices  (e.g.,  desktop, 

 laptop,  PDA,   phone).  The   new  service  delivery  and  deployment  methods  give  users  the 

 maximum  flexibility  and  portability on  the  use  of  the  services  they  paid  for  to  meet  the 

 business volatility requirement.  However, the designer  and  the  developer should  also  know 

the  limitations of a  
                         web  browser or a thin-client they are restricted to. 

New pricing  &  
                     business models 

The  ability to  scale  operations  up  and  down  smoothly  as  market  conditions  and  business 

environments  change  is  
                               one  of the  key elements for  companies  to stay  agile and  successful 

in  today's  world.  IT  
                          expenditures  as  one  of the  biggest capital  investment  to  a business  are 

always  under  scrutiny when  it comes to financial  planning or  cost  reduction.  Use  of clouds 

 helps  companies  of  different  sizes  to  change  from  a fixed  cost  model  to  a variable  cost 

 model  in  terms  of IT  
                           operating  expenses.  It  is very attractive to small  businesses or startups 

that  are  starved  for  cash  when  they  are  expanding.  It  also  gives  enterprises  competitive 

advantage  when  they  have the  luxury of scaling  up  and  down  quickly.  However, while the 

 benefit  is obvious,  many  companies  are   reluctant  to  move   because  either  their  capital 

expenditures  have  been  done  or  their  new  spending  model  has  yet  to  be  built  into  the 

overall  business  processes  in the  company. 

Benefits  of Cloud  Computing 

 In a report  on  public sector  cloud  computing published  by the  Federal  CIO  Council  (Kundra, 

2010), the  benefits of cloud computing  are  summarized  into six areas: 

                                                     -9-

    "   Economical. Cloud  computing  is a pay-as-you-go  approach  to  IT,  

        investment  is required  to  get going. Additional  investment is incurred  as system  use 

        increases  and  costs can  decrease  if  usage  decreases.  In this way,  cash  flows  better 

        match  total system  cost. 

    "   Flexible.  IT departments  that  anticipate  fluctuations  in   user  load  do  not  have  to 

        scramble  to  secure  additional  hardware  and  software.  With  cloud  computing, they 

        can  add  and  subtract  capacity  as  its  network  load  dictates,  and  pay  only  for what 

        they use. 

    "    Rapid  Implementation.  Without  the   need  to   go  through  the  procurement   and 

        certification  processes,  and  with  a  near-limitless  selection  of  services,  tools,  and 

        features,  cloud  computing helps projects  get off the  ground  in  record  time. 

    *    Consistent  Service.   Network  outages  can   send   an   IT department  scrambling  for 

        answers.  Cloud  computing  can  offer  a higher  level  of service  and  reliability, and  an 

         immediate  response to emergency situations. 

    e    Increased  Effectiveness.  Cloud  computing frees  the  user from  the  finer  details  of IT 

        system   configuration  and      maintenance,   enabling  them   to  spend   more  time  on 

         mission-critical tasks  and  less time on  IT operations  and  maintenance. 

    "   Energy  Efficient. Because  resources  are  pooled,  each  user community  does  not  need 

        to  have  its  own  dedicated  IT infrastructure.  Several  groups  can   share  computing 

         resources,    leading  to   higher   utilization   rates,   fewer   servers,   and  less  energy 

        consumption. 

Technology Adoption  Curve 

Due  to  these  unique  characteristics,  many  companies  and  organizations  that  have  had 

extensive  experiences with  conventional  network systems  are  tempted  to  maintain  current 

technology  in  order  to avoid switching  risks or  "unknown"   risks. Very  often  it falls  onto the 

shoulder of their consultants or contractors  (vendors) to  build the  business case  and  defend 

the  benefits  of cloud  computing. While  cloud  computing  is a well-established  concept  and 

encompassed  by the academic  community,  pioneer technology developers,  and  all  major  IT 

service  providers, there  is still considerable  gap  between them  and  the  rest of the  business

world,   especially  in  the  traditional  sectors  such  as              manufacturing,  finance,   healthcare, 

 governmental  departments,  etc.  It could  be an  extra  burden  to the vendors  to demonstrate 

 and deliver the  benefits. 

 While  it  is unclear  if  and  when   all  conventional  information  systems  will  transition  into 

 cloud  computing, there  is a clear  trend  that  more  and  more  companies  and  organizations 

 are  moving towards  to  cloud  computing. Just  like any other  new technology  or  innovation, 

 this  transition  follows  the  typical  technology  adoption  curve  (Figure   1).   In  March  2011, 

Avanade  commissioned  a survey  of  573  C-level  executives  in  18  countries.  The  research 

 finds  cloud  computing  has  reached  it  first  milestone  as  a  mature  technology  (Avanade, 

 2011). According to the survey,  74% of enterprises  are  using some form  of cloud services.

                                                                  Cloud 

                                                                  Computing

Different  business sectors  may fall  into different categories.  It is noticed by  experts  in Cloud 

Computing  that  cloud  adoption  is stronger  in  small  businesses  and  big enterprises, while  it 

stays very  low  in  middle sized  companies. The  explanation  is simple.  Small  companies  often 

have  IT infrastructure shortages  and  limited  IT budgets.  IT is  
                                                                                 considered  a pure  cost  instead 

of a valuable  resource.  Cloud  computing  allows them  to use  sophisticated tools without the 

trouble of acquiring and  managing a complicated  technological  infrastructure, and  pay at  a 

price  that   is  metered  from          real   usage.    For   big  enterprises,  cloud   computing  can              be

leveraged  in   a different  way:  the  cloud  is considered  a solid  way  to  deal  with  variable 

workload   and  to  delegate  services,  a viable  alternative  to  outsourcing.  More  and  more 

private  clouds  are  used  internally  and  interact  with   public  clouds  to  exchange  data  and 

services  in  a more  or  less transparent  way when  needed.  Medium  size companies typically, 

have  a real  IT budget  including human  and  material  resources,  but  resistance to change and 

outsourcing  make cloud computing a less favorite choice. 

The   anticipated   business   benefits   in   terms  of  business  case,   financial  value,  strategic 

direction   and  flexibility  provided  are   appreciated            by  organizations  worldwide   and  the 

current  adoption  curve  confirms that cloud  computing  is here to stay  and  has  a potential to 

                                    From  a vendor  side,  there  is still work  required to  improve  the 
transform  business and  IT.  

 understanding   of  cloud         computing   as      the   market      is  missing   a  clear   and      universal 

 understanding  of what  cloud  computing  is, the  different  types  and  the  different  services. 

                            departments  need  to  be  involved. As  maturity  increases and  offerings 
 Both  business and  IT  

 get  broader and  clearer, organizations  will further  expand  their cloud  sourcing  and vary the 

 models they use.

     2.2       Healthcare Information Systems 

     Just  like  in  all  other  industries,  healthcare  information  systems  have  gone  through  many 

     changes  to  evolve from  verbal  descriptions  and  paper  based  manual  processes  to  modern 

     computer  based  data  collection and  information  process systems.  Healthcare  information  is 

     sensitive to  both  patients  and  physicians who  create  the  information  and  scientists who  use 

     the  information  to  conduct  research.  Privacy  and  security  are  the  top  concerns.  In recent 

     years,  there  has  been  increasing  demand  from  both  the  healthcare  community  and  the 

     government  for  more  advanced  and  easy  to  use  Healthcare  Information  Technology  (HIT) 

     systems,  in  order to  meet the  regulations and  rules established. 

     Overview  of Healthcare Information Systems 

     The  definitions  of  the  types  of  health  care  information  vary  by  different  organizations. 

     According  to  (Wager,   Lee,   &  Glaser,   2009),  there   are   mainly  two  types  of  healthcare 

     information: the  administrative  information,  and  the clinical information.  Focusing on  these 

     two  types  of  healthcare   information,   HIT   systems  are   also  centered   on   administrative 

     systems  or clinical systems.

     and  significant  federal  initiatives  had  enormous  influence  on  the  evolution  of  healthcare 

     information  systems.  For  example,  in   1980s  the  unveiling of  affordable  and  powerful  PCs 

     promoted  the  use  of  HIT   in   small          healthcare  organizations,  and   in   2000s  the  federal

    review  the  recent  most  important  legislation  and   regulations  that  shape  the  healthcare 

    environment. 

                                                                 Regulations 
   Important Recent  Healthcare legislation  and  

        1)   HIPAA 

         In  1996,   Congress   passed   the  Health        Insurance   Portability  and   Accountability  Act 

         (HIPAA)  in  hope of  improving the  portability and  continuity of health  insurance;  combat 

        waste,  fraud,  and  abuse  in  health  insurance  and  health care  delivery;  promote  medical 

         savings  accounts;  improve access  to  long-term  care  services  and  coverage;  and  simplify 

        the  administration  of  health  insurance;  and  for  other  purposes  (NIST,               Effect  of  the 

         HIPAA  Privacy  Rule  on  Health  Research).  In 2003  the  Title  Il of  HIPAA was  passed with 

         additional regulations on the use  and disclosure of Protected  Health  Information  (PHI). 

         The  HIPAA defines  a set  of  rules to facilitate  continuation  of  health  insurance  coverage 

         among  American  workers  who  change  employers.  The  HIPAA  Security  Rule  specifically 

         focuses  on  the  safeguarding  of  Electronic  Protected  Health  Information  (EPHI).              Under 

         the  HIPAA Security  Rule,  each covered  entity'  must: 

              *   Ensure  the  confidentiality,  integrity,  and  availability  of  EPHI   that  it  creates, 

                  receives,  maintains, or transmits; 

              *   Protect  against any  reasonably anticipated threats  and  hazards to the security  or 

                  integrity of  EHPI; 

              *   Protect  against  reasonably  anticipated  uses  or  disclosures  of  such  information 

                  that are  not permitted  by the  Privacy  Rule. 

         2)  FISMA 

         In addition  to  HIPAA,  the  Federal   Information  Security  Management  Act  (FISMA)  also 

         affects the  use  of  HIT.  FISMA  enacted  into  law  in  2002  defines three security  objectives 

         for  federal  government  information  systems:  (1) Confidentiality,  (2) Integrity,  and  (3) 

 Covered entities  include covered  healthcare  providers,  health  plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and  Medicare 
prescription drug  card sponsors.  Details  on covered  entities can  be found  in the NIST  document. 

                                                        - 16- 

----------------------- Page 18-----------------------

Availability. The  purpose  of FISMA  and  HIPAA was  to  establish  a uniform  set of federal 

 standards  nationwide for  how  health  plans and  most  health  care  providers should  treat 

 the  identifiable health  information that they receive from their patients. 

 FISMA  applies to  all  federal  agencies  and  all  information  types.  Some  federal  agencies 

 are  subject  to  the  HIPAA  Security  Rule  based  on  their  functions  and  use  of  EPHI.  All 

 HIPAA  covered  entities,  which  includes  some  federal  agencies,  must  comply  with  the 

 HIPAA    Security    Rule.   The    Security    Rule   specifically   focuses    on    protecting   the 

 confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of  EPHI. 

3)  ARRA   and  
                  HITECH  
                             Act 

 HIPAA  is important from  a policy standpoint,  but  most of the  impetus  for  HIT  adoption, 

 primarily  Electronic  Health  Records   (EHR),      comes  from   the  American        Recovery  and 

 Reinvestment  Act   (ARRA)       stimulus  bill   in the  form   of  incentive  payments  through 

 Medicare & Medicaid. 

The  ARRA  was  signed  into  law  by  President  Obama  on  February  17,  2009  to  stimulate 

the  U.S.   economy  and  simultaneously   promote  certain   policy  objectives.  It  touches 

almost  every  aspect  of the  U.S.  economy.  It prevents  dramatic  state  cuts  in  Medicaid, 

expands funding for  preventive  health care  services and  health care  research,  and  helps 

the  unemployed buy  health  insurance.  Its  most  profound  effect on  doctors  and  patients 

will  result from  its unprecedented  $19  billion  program  to promote the  adoption and  use 

of  HIT  and  especially  EHRs  (Blumenthal,  2009).  Among  the  $19   billion, $17   billion  is in 

financial  incentives for physicians  and  hospitals to  adopt and  use  EHRs,  and $2 billion for 

ONC   to  put  support  systems  in   place  for  technical  help  and   improvements  and  to 

authorize  a  
              variety of tools for  building the  requisite infrastructure. 

The  Health  Information  Technology  for  Economic  and  Clinical  Health  (HITECH)            Act  was 

signed  as  a  part  of ARRA  to  promote the  adoption  of  HIT  by  physicians  and  hospitals 

with   a  prescribed     timeline.   The    HITECH     authorizes    incentive    payments   through 

Medicare  and  Medicaid on demonstrated  meaningful  use of certified  EHRs.

        What  is "meaningful   use  of  certified  EHRs"?   First  of  all,  to  qualify  as   certified  EHR 

        technology,   a  system       must   be  tested   and  certified   by  the   Office  of  the  National 

        Coordinator for  Health  Information Technology  (ONC).  The  ONC  keeps and  releases  a list 

        of approved  EHRs  that  have been  determined  to  meet the  requirements  of "meaningful 

                                                                                 2 
         use". The  list is called Certified  Health  IT Product List  (CHPL)     . 

        Secondly, the term  "meaningful  use"  means: the  use of a certified  EHR  in  a meaningful 

         manner,  such  that  it  complies  with  a set  of  objectives.  In short,  meaningful  use  will 

         require  that  providers  document  that  they  are  using  certified  EHR  technology  in  ways 

        that can  be  measured  in quality and  in  quantity (Turner, 2011). 

        The  Federal  government  provides  a pool  of  HITECH  funds to  pay eligible  professions  up 

        to   $44,000   in     reimbursements       from     Medicare     and    $65,000   from      Medicaid     for 

         meaningful  use  of  a certified  EHR   starting  in  2011.  It  is no  surprise  that  a swarm  of 

        technology  vendors  started  to  promote  a vast  array  of technologies  designed  to fulfill 

         the  HITECH   vision  of  integrating  advanced  technology  into  the  delivery  of  healthcare 

         services.  In the  rush  to  implement  EHR  solutions  and  receive financial  incentives, many 

         organizations  overlook  the  importance  of  selecting  an  appropriate  technology  rather 

         than  a one-size-fits-all  solution.  However,  it  is very  encouraging  to  see   many  of  the 

         solutions  on the CHPL  are  cloud computing  based  solutions. 

         This   type   of  government       stimulation     has   played   an    essential    role   in   advancing 

         technology  adoption  in  the  health  care  industry. While we  have  to  admit  the  apparent 

         benefits for the quickened  industry wide  movement  towards  using  newer technologies, 

         we   should   also   note  that  it  causes   a  cyclic  effect   on   certain  types  of  technology 

         development. This  cyclic effect of government stimulation  plans will  be  discussed  later.

     4)  ACA 

     The  Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA)  was  enacted  on   March  23,  2010.  It  contains  some  tax 

     provisions that  became  effective  in  2010  or 2011,  with  more to  be  implemented  in  the 

     next several  years. 

     According  to  a 2011  survey,  the  reforms  at  the  ACA  in  the  U.S.            could  stimulate  the 

     reduction  of the  number of underinsured  adults  in the  country  by  70  percent  upon the 

     increase of the  affordability of care for people  (Cathy  Schoen,  2011). 

     According   to   another  survey   (The   Kaiser         Family   Foundation   and       Health    Research 

     Educational  Trust,  2011)  the  two  most  popular  provisions  of  the  ACA   reform   law  - 

     allowing  young  adults  to  stay  on  their  parents'   insurance  policies  until  age  26  and 

     requiring  health  plans to offer some  preventive service for free  -together   accounted for 

     about  2%  
                  increase  in  insurance  premiums.  However, the  average  annual  premium  was 

     8% higher for  individual  coverage,  or  9% higher  for  family  coverage.  The  increase  was 

     only 3%  
                in 2010. 

     At  the  same time,  one  study  (The  Commonwealth   Fund,  2011)  appeared  in  the journal 

     Health    Policy   shows     that   the    U.S.   ranked     last  among      high-income      nations   on 

     preventable deaths. 

     Since  the  birth  of the  ACA,  criticism  that  the  ACA  has  caused  a  rise  in  health  benefit 

     premiums  has  never stopped.  It is understandable.  Many  people believe that Americans 

     are   paying  higher  premiums  with  less  quality  in  return.  Adding  more  people  to  the 

     insured  pool seems to  make things worse. 

Issues of legislation  and Regulations 

The  HIPAA,  FISMA,  HITECH,  and  ARA  were  formed  at  different times with  different  focuses. 

But  they are  also  interrelated,  e.g. the  HITECH  Act  contains  a number of important changes 

to  HIPAA  privacy and security  requirements for  physician  practices (Shiner,  2010). They also 

share   the   common        goal   to   promote      the   development       of  a  nationwide        healthcare 

information  network and  to create a helpful  and  holistic medical  records system  to  address

      wide  range of healthcare  issues. As  the  population  ages  and  healthcare  costs soar,  making 
    a  

    the  healthcare  service  more  efficient  and  effective, as  well  as finding the  means to  reduce 

    costs, are the top  priorities for the  healthcare  industry. 

     However, we  should  also  note that  this  legislation  and  regulations  have  side  effects to the 

     healthcare  community.  The  first  issue  is the  lack  of  enforcement,  or  inconsistency when 

    there  is enforcement.  One  goal  of the  regulations  is to  maintain  an  appropriate  balance 

     between  protecting  individual  privacy  and  the  ability to  use  the  de-identified  healthcare 

     information  for  the  common  good.  But  sometimes  those  laws  don't  match  up  and  cause 

     confusion.  The   HHS  delegated  to  the  Administrator,  Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid 

     Services  (CMS),      the  authority  to  investigate  complaints  of  noncompliance.  The  current 

     "complaint-driven"  enforcement  process  leaves  many  unturned stones.  CMS  has  recognized 

    the  need  for  an  enhanced  enforcement  process  whereby  CMS  would  proactively address 

     compliance   issues  through  a  compliance  audit   process.3  The   new  process  is yet  to   be 

    developed. 

    Another   issue  is the  problems  caused  for  the  secondary  uses  of  PHI.                     All   individually 

     identifiable  health  information  held  or transmitted  by  a covered  entity  is protected  under 

    the   Privacy   Rule.   The      regulations   allow   the   use       of   non-identifiable  or   de-Identified 

     information   for   secondary         uses    such    as   for   scientific   research,     administrative       use, 

     comparative   performance           use,   etc.  The    Privacy   Rule   does   not  supersede   either   FDA 

     regulations  on  research  or  the  Common   Rule4. "De-identified"   PHI  is under  no  disclosure 

     restrictions.  It  is more  acceptable  to  use  the  data  for common  good  (e.g. for  research),  but 

     many  businesses  also  use  the  data  for  commercial  purpose  such  as  service  targeting  and 

     advertising.  The  current  regulations  are  not  always  clear  on  the  restriction  of  secondary 

     uses of PHI. 

                         the variability  in  the  interpretation  of the  HIPAA  Privacy  Rule. The  Covered 
     A  third  issue  is  

     Entities  are  a  limited  set  of entities.  If the  entity  that  is using  the  health  care  data  is not

 covered  by  HIPAA,  then  they  are  only  concerned  when  access  to  information  is from  a 

 covered  entity.  It  causes  limitations  on  some  important  types  of  research,  such  as  chart 

 reviews,  retrospective  cohort  studies,  population-based  case  control  studies,  multi-center 

 studies, and  so  on. 

 However,  despite  all  the  issues  and  concerns  about  the  legislation  and  regulations,  they 

 sent  strong  positive signals  to the  healthcare  industry to  build  a better and  more  organized 

 healthcare information  network using advanced technologies. 

 On  a Pragmatic  
                     Level 

 Reducing  health  care  costs while  providing  better  health  care  services  is  
                                                                                         the  ultimate  goal, 

 and  it are  not easy to achieve.  Health care  is  
                                                      a  
                                                        far-reaching  issue  because  it is a basic right of 

 human  beings and  it affects everyone's  daily  life. At the  national  level,  it became  one  of the 

 most  critical tasks  and  challenges  for the  administration  and  the  legislation.  Because  of the 

 importance  of the  issue, while  the  politicians and  the  media  are focused  on  the  high-profile 

 debates,  many  medical  providers,  scientists and  researchers  are  spending  lots  of their time 

 and  energy trying to tackle on the  challenges at pragmatic  level. 

 Developing and  promoting  cost  effective  HIT  systems  is one of the  areas  that can  positively 

 impact health care  reform. The  adoption of the  EHR  can  increase  efficiency and  improve the 

quality  of  healthcare.  A better connected  information  network  could  reduce  losses  due  to 

fraud.  Although  HIT  by  itself cannot  solve the  problem  of  high  healthcare  cost,  developing 

an  interoperable  healthcare  information  network can  provide a platform  to  implement  real- 

time  controls.  There   is a  study  shows  that  such   an   infrastructure   investment  has  the 

potential to  produce  significant national  savings  (Parante,  Mandelbaum,  Hanson,  Cassidy,  & 

Simborg,  2008). 

As   discussed  above,  users  of  PHI   can   range  from   patients,  service  providers,  insurance 

companies,  to  researchers  and  government  agencies.  There   is a tremendous  amount  of 

data  accumulated  or  being  accumulated  over  time.  Different  users  need  data  mining  and 

analysis   for   both   research    and    interventional    usages.    One   example      is  the   Scalable 

Nationwide  Network for  Effectiveness Research  (SCANNER)  study, funded  by the Agency for 

                                                  -21- 

----------------------- Page 23-----------------------

   Healthcare  Research  and  Quality  (AHRQ)  and  led  by  Principal  Investigators  at  UCSD   & MIT, 

  which  evaluates  effectiveness  of  clinical  interventions  in  real  populations. The  SCANNER 

   project will develop  a scalable,  secure  network for  comparative  effectiveness  research  that 

   allows  for flexibility in disclosure  policy and  data  sharing  among  participant  sites.  This  kind 

   of study  relies  on  the  data  collected  in  the  process  of care  across  different  time,  location, 

  format, and  very often on  different network systems. 

   Cloud  computing  is considered  a suitable  solution  for these  requirements  by  many experts 

   in   the  field.   It   is scalable,   easier  to  implement,   and   easier  to  share.         However,  most 

   healthcare  or  clinical  organizations  are  relatively  new  to  cloud  computing  comparing  to 

   government  agencies  and  large  providers. The  challenge  is how to overcome  the  concerns 

   these  healthcare  organizations   have  on:   1) How  security,  safety,  and   reliability  of  data 

   storage  in  the  cloud  are  being  ensured;  and  2)  How  to  work with  the  existing  healthcare 

   networks  and  standards,  such  as   Nationwide  Health  Information  Network  (NwHIN)   and 

   Health  Information  Exchange  (HIE)  vendorss 

   NwHIN   seeks  to   provide  a  nationwide  interoperable   health   information   infrastructure 

                                                                                                      almost  always 
   (network  of networks) for  secure  data  exchange over  the Internet.  NwHIH  is  

   deployed   as     the   CONNECT        Gateway.      CONNECT       is  open   source      software   with   three 

   components:   1) Gateway,  which   implements  NwHIN  specifications;  2)  Enterprise  Service 

   Platform,  which  enables  connections  to  the  Gateway;  and  3) Universal  Client  Framework, 

   which  provides  a development  platform  for end-user  applications. 

   This  landscape  is changing as  HHS  is now  pushing  NwHIN  Direct.  NwHIN  Direct  describes  a 

   set  of  standards,  services  and  policies  to  guide  the  development  of  secure   health  data 

   exchange  over the  Internet.  It  is a much  simpler  and  less  capable  solution  downsized from 

   NwHIN  since  NwHIN  has  proved to  be  too complicated.  "While  CONNECT  was  developed  to 

   meet the  needs  and  requirements  of government  agencies  and  large  organizations,  NwHIN 

   Direct  focuses  on  smaller  entities, such  as  physician-to-physician  connectivity.  It  builds  off 

   CONNECT  to  offer  an  additional  set  of  standards  and  specifications  to  support  point-to- 

E.g.  InterSystems, Axolotl,  Medicity, DBMotion,  etc.

of the  office  of standards  and  interoperability in  the  Office of the  National  Coordinator for 

HIT (Goedert, 2010). 

Many of these  issues  represent  both technical  and  business challenges.  Evaluation  of these 

issues  can  be very  difficult when  they face  a new project.  It is critical for  decision-makers to 

choose the  optimal  approach  early on  in the  project to ensure  its final  success.

3.   System  Analysis 

     3.1       The Healthcare Information Technology  (HIT)  Ecosystem 

                                                                              but  it  is a subset  domain  of  IT. Many 
     As  the  name  suggested,  HIT  is in  the  domain  of  IT,  

     generic  IT developments  can  be  directly  applied  to  HIT  systems.  There  are  also  healthcare 

     domain   specific  characteristics  that  differentiate                  HIT   systems  from   other  types  of   IT 

     systems.  Within  HIT,  there  are  also  numerous  sub-systems  that  make  up  the  entire  core 

     functionalities  supporting  healthcare  information  systems'  needs,  e.g.  EHR  is one  of them. 

     For  the  purpose  of  refining the  discussion  in  this  thesis,  the  scope  of IT, HIT,  and  EHR  is 

     illustrated in  Figure  2.

      HIT  as  a system  has  all  elements to  be  an  Ultra-Large-Scale  (ULS)   system  by  the  measures

      interdependencies among subsystems;  and the  number of software and  hardware  elements 

      (Northrop  & AL,  2006).  The  large  HIT  system  affects  virtually  all  players  in  the  healthcare 

     community.  It is such  a broad technology that complementary  investment  in  a broad  set  of 

      areas  is required  to  maximize  the  value  of HIT. A  study done  by  RAND  Corporation  (Bower, 

                                                              -  24-

                                                        diffusion  in  other  industries and  indicated that  HIT 

 is definitely  not  a stand-alone  or  plug-and-play  type  of benefit,  it  is much  more  effective 

when  combined  with  vigorous competition  and  deregulation,  and  when  used  appropriately 

 it can  deliver dramatic changes in  the overall  delivery of care. 

Healthcare Entities 

Compared  to other types  of information  technologies,  HIT  has  its own  characteristics.  First 

of all,  it is important to  understand the complexity of the  healthcare  network. As  illustrated 

in  Figure  3, HIT systems  interact with  a broad span  of healthcare entities. These  entities  play 

diversified  roles  and  they  must  cooperate  with  each  other  in  order  for  proper  healthcare 

information  to  be  created,  maintained,  transmitted,  and   utilized.  These  entities  are  the 

owners of the HIT systems,  at the same time they are also the customers. 

                                                         overnment 
                                                        Agencies

----------------------- Page 27-----------------------

Another  important  characteristic  is the  uneven  use  of  information  technology  in  different 

healthcare  entities.  While  some  hospitals  are  using  advanced  computing  and  information 

systems to  provide  modern  services, some other  health care facilities  may still rely on  paper 

based     manual      processes   to   collect   data.   To      build   a  reliable   HIT     infrastructure,  the 

development  and  advancement  of  HIT  cannot  be  locally focused.  Because  the  healthcare 

entities  are  interconnected to  each  other, healthcare  information  and  other  data  has  to  be 

communicated  and shared. 

Market Structure 

 Market structure is defined  by the number and  size  of the firms  in the  market;  the ease with 

which  firms   may  enter  and   exit  the   market;  the  degree  to  which  firms'   products  are 

differentiated;  and the  information available to  both  buyers and  sellers  regarding  prices and 

 product  characteristics.   Market  structure   characteristics  determine   competition,  which 

 ranges  from  perfect  competition  where  there  are  many  small  sellers  and  many  buyers,  a 

 homogenous  product  and  everyone  is a price-taker, to  a pure  monopoly  where  there  is only 

 one supplier or  a monopsony, a market with  only one  buyer. Between  these extremes  there 

 are  other  structures such  as  monopolistic competition  (many  buyers and  many  sellers with 

 a differentiated  product)  and  oligopoly with  a few  sellers  varying  in  size  and  power  in  the 

 market.  The      ideal  economic  structure   is  perfect   competition  which   has   the  following 

 characteristic:  many  sellers and  many  buyers  and  each  one  individually too  small  to  affect 

 price levels so they are  all  price-taker not  price-sellers (Mwachofi  & AI-Assaf,  2011). 

 The  HIT  market structure  is complicated.  As  we  have  discussed,  HIT  is an  ultra  large  system 

 with  a large  amount  of players.  Each  of the  healthcare  entity segments  (as  shown  in  Figure 

 3)  is big  enough  to  form  its  own  market.  For  example,  the  health  care   receivers  have  a 

 consumer-oriented  market with  products  range  from  home  care  devices to  on-line  health 

 condition self-assessment,  etc. 

 The  healthcare  provider  market can  be  segmented  into  large hospital  (>200  beds),  midsized 

 hospitals  (100~200  beds),  small  hospitals  (<100  beds),  and  physician  practices. Within  these 

 segments,  the  large  and   midsized  hospitals  often  behave  more  like  standard  enterprise 

                                                       -  26- 

----------------------- Page 28-----------------------

 customers     in   the  macro     IT  space,  while   small    hospitals  and     physician   practices  are 

 demonstrably  more  adverse  to  significant  capital  expenditures  (Harding,  2009).  The  HIT 

 vendors   have   become   associated   with   specific   market   segments.            For   example,   large 

 companies   like  Allscripts,  Cerner,  and   Epic  are  the   main  vendors  for  the  large  hospital 

 market.   McKesson   is the  dominant  player  in  the   midsize  hospital   market,  and   smaller 

 hospitals  are  predominantly served  by companies  such  as  Computer  Programs  and  Systems. 

Allscripts   is the  best  known   name  in  the  physician  practice  market,  which   is the  most 

 numerous and fragmented  market segment. 

 The   RAND   study   (Bower,  2005)   also   concluded  that  there  were   neither  empirical   nor 

 theoretical  reasons  to worry  about too  many  or too few  buyers or sellers  in  the  HIT  market. 

 There   are   a  substantial   number  of  HIT  suppliers   providing  various   HIT   products.  The 

 entrance  barrier  is low as  it is relatively easy for  new  players to find  niche  markets  in  HIT to 

 start their ventures. 

The  EHR  market  has  become  a more  condensed  market  however.  In 2002,  7 suppliers  had 

 74%  of the  EHR     market  and  the  remaining  26%  were  composed  of  smaller  players  and 

 home-grown  systems  (Bower,  2005).  Today,  the top four  EHR  vendors  made  up  80% of the 

 EHR  market, with  hundreds  of smaller  players  in  the  remaining  20%.  We  see  mergers  and 

acquisitions  are  still happening among  the  EHR  venders,  e.g.  Allscripts  merged  with  Eclipsys 

 in 2011. 

We    should     also  notice   the    presence     of   Health   Center    Controlled     Network   (HCCN) 

organizations. According  to the  Health  Resources  and  Services  Administration  (HRSA,  HHS), 

a  HCCN     is "a  group  of  safety  net  providers  with  a  minimum   of  three  collaborators  or 

members  collaborating  horizontally or vertically to  improve access  to care,  enhance  quality 

of care,  and  achieve  cost efficiencies through  the redesign  of practices to  integrate services, 

optimize   patient   outcomes,   or        negotiate   managed       care   contracts   on    behalf   of  the 

participating  members."        These   HCCN      organizations  assume       responsibility  for   research, 

development,   negotiations  and   vendor   management   on               behalf  of  multiple   healthcare 

facilities  in  terms  of  developing  and/or  adopting  new  HIT  systems.  By  centralizing  these

There  has  been  a lot  of talk  of transitioning toward  a subscription  model  for  HIT  to  better 

align  the  cash   outflows  associated  with   purchasing  a  system   with  the   Medicare  and 

 Medicaid  incentive  payments.  In the  physician  practice  or  ambulatory   market,  we  have 

already  seen the  software-as-a-service take  hold  (The Wall  Street Transcript,  Aug  10,  2009). 

The  emergence  of the  cloud  computing  model  of  product  delivery  is compelling  for  small 

 hospitals and  physician  practices,  because  it allows  them  to  match  their  expenditures  with 

their revenue stream while avoiding big  upfront HIT investment. 

The   increased   prevalence  of  cloud  computing  also  pushes   HIT  vendors  to  explore  and 

 expand     more  types  of  cloud   computing   offerings.   However,  for  large   enterprise-sized 

 healthcare   providers,   in-house        perpetual   license   products  continue  to   be   considered 

 preferred  option  because of their existing investments and  sizable  IT department. 

 Understanding  the  HIT  ecosystem  and  integrating  the  relevant  information  together  will 

 enable  new  information  technology  adoption  to  be  better synchronized  with  the  real-time 

 needs  of  the  healthcare  network  in an   economically  feasible  context.  Although  we  will 

 emphasize the  cloud  computing  aspects  in  our future  discussion, we  should  also  note that 

 the same  philosophy is applicable to any types  of new technology adoptions. 

 3.2      System Architecture 

 Cloud  computing services are  offered  most commonly  in the following ways: 

      *   Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (laaS):  storage  and  computing  resources  as  a service. The 

          main  advantages  are  lower costs,  increased  flexibility, and  the ability to  rapidly start 

           up   and   shut  down   services.   This   type  of  service   also   helps   moderate   capital 

          expenditures   by      reducing  the   need   for   on-site   data   center   infrastructure   and 

          computing  systems.

        e       Platform-as-a-Service  (Paas):   tools  and  environments  to  build  and  operate  cloud 

                applications and  services. This  is newer  in the  marketplace,  but adoption  is expected 

                to increase  significantly over the  next few years. 

        *       Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS):   on-demand   use  of  software  over  the   Internet.  This 

                type  of  services  has  been  on  the  market  for  several  years,  and  has  the  greatest 

                uptake so far. 

        *       IT-as-a-Service  (ITaaS):  or sometimes  is called  Business  Process  as  a Service  (BPaaS). 

                This  service  type  combines  the  application  elements  of  cloud  computing  with  a 

                human  aspect. The  main  difference  from  traditional                                                          IT

                the   human   resources   providing  the   ITaaS                                               service   are   pooled   as  well                              between

There  are  also  several  distinct  deployment  models  for  business  use  of  cloud  computing, 

including: 

     "   Public cloud:  Public cloud  computing  uses the  public internet and  shared  computing 

         resources to deliver  services  and  capacity on  demand.  This  model  uses  one  or  more 

         data  centers  that  are  shared  among  multiple  customers,  with  varying  degrees  of 

         data  privacy  and   control.  From  the  customer's  perspective,  using  public  cloud  is 

         similar   to  outsourcing,  except  the   scalability   is  greater   and   the  billing  model 

         resembles a utility. 

     *   Private   cloud:   Private  cloud   computing   architectures   are   modeled   after  public 

         clouds,  but  they're   built,  managed,  and   used   internally  by  an  organization.  This 

         model  uses  a shared   services  model  with  variable   usage  of  a common   pool  of 

         virtualized  computing resources.  Data  is controlled within  the organization. 

     *   Hybrid   cloud:  This   is  a  mix  of  public   cloud   services,   private  cloud   computing 

         architectures,  and   classic   IT infrastructure,  forming  a  hybrid   model  to  meeting 

         specific  needs.  Static  hybrid   cloud  computing  does  not  share  data  and  services 

         between  the  public  and  private  components.  Dynamic  hybrid  cloud  computing  is 

                                                                                      they are  located 
                           way that  data  and  services are  interchangeable  as  if  
         architected  in  a  

         in  the  same  virtual  operating  system.  Supplier  relationship  management  is a good 

         example  of an  application that fits well  with a hybrid  model. 

These  system  architectures  and  models  are  applicable to cloud  computing  in  all types  of  IT 

 environment,  including HIT. 

 3.3     Business  Dynamics 

 In previous sections, we  mentioned  the  cyclic  effect  of government  stimulating  acts  on  HIT 

 development.  To  be  more  specific, when  the  Federal  or  State  government  passes  laws  or 

 stimulating  plans  to  promote  advanced  technology  adoption  in   healthcare  by  providing 

 incentives to  individuals  or  institutions,  it will  inevitably  create  a  rush  to  implement  the 

 technology  being  promoted.  These  laws  and  acts  can  make  enormous  strides  in  advancing 

                                                -30- 

----------------------- Page 32-----------------------

technology adoptions,  but  the  strides  sometime  can  be  so  large that the  whole  body  may 

 lose  balance when  the  legs move too fast. 

Take the  HITECH  Act  as  an  example.  Many organizations  have adopted  certified  EHR  quickly 

in  order to qualify for the incentives.  However, hospitals or  healthcare facilities have  unique 

workflows,  clinical  concerns,  and   limitations  of  existing  infrastructures.  During  the  quick 

adoption  wave,  the  drivers  that  should   motivate  the  organization  to  implement  health 

information  technology  shift  from   improving  clinical  care  and   practice  to  achieving  the 

HITECH      incentives.  As   a  result,  understanding  of  the  organizations'   specific  needs  and 

requirements,  incorporating  of  physicians'  and  user  groups'   inputs,  and   integrating  with 

existing IT infrastructures and systems, will  become secondary priorities. 

No  EHRs  are  designed to  operate  in  isolation.  If the  above  concerns  were  not addressed  at 

the  beginning of the  adoption, sooner or later, they will  become such  a big obstacle that the 

players  in  the  field  have to  stop  and  take  a step  back to  revaluate  them.  That  will  be  the 

time we  see  a drawback  of the  rapid growth  in  new technologies. 

Figure  5 shows the effect of government stimulation  act on technology adoption curve.

4.  Findings - The framework 

                                                                                            to  research  and 
As we  stated  in  the  proposal  of this thesis,  the  purpose of this  research work  is  

define  a framework  for  cloud  computing  adoption  in  healthcare  information  systems  when 

moving forward  from  traditional  computing  approaches.  Users  of  this framework  can  be  the 

cloud  providers  and  developers  (the Vendors),  or  the  network  computing  service  seekers  (the 

Clients). 

To  make the framework  a complete approach,  we  looked at: 

     "   The  adoption  curve  of technologies across  the  board 

    *    the system  architecture and  ecosystems of the  cloud computing; 

    *    the stages of each  of the  layers and  players in  the transition  process; 

     e   the  roles of each  player during the transition,  and  their business models; 

     e   the comparison  method  in both technical  and  business areas; 

     e   and the comparison of risks and  unknowns. 

The  transition  is a dynamic  process that changes  over time.  Instead of building one  instance of 

the  framework  that  only fits  today's  market  situation,  we  tried  to  build  one  that  can  be  used 

 over  time  with  updated  information,  as  various  players  move  from  their  current  stage  to the 

 next on the technology adoption  curve. 

 The  proposed framework  also  considers the  specific  marketplace  conditions  and  regulations  in 

 related  to  Healthcare,  as  they  play  a critical  role  in  the  development  of  HIT  systems  and  the 

 adoption  of cloud computing. 

 As   shown  in   Figure  6, the  proposed  framework  consists  of  five  major  categories:  Strategy, 

 Regulations   &   Policies,   Technology,   Implementation,   and        Evaluation.   This   framework     is 

 developed  based  on  organizational  decision  making  process  and  provides  matching  tools  to 

 address decision  maker's concerns. The  framework  can  be  used to  reason  about  and  investigate 

 cloud  adoption decisions.

recommend         that   the    users    use   the   following      evaluation      process    to   get    a  thorough 

understanding and  better alignment for their project.

4.1       Strategy 

The  adoption  of cloud  computing  is an  organizational  challenge that should  not be  isolated 

from  other  organizational  goals  and  strategies.  Establishing  clear  organizational  goals  and 

strategies  for the  use  of cloud  computing  is  
                                                        the first  critical  step  in  cloud  adoption.  More 

than  half organizations  who  has  successfully  adopted  cloud  computing  defined  a five-year 

technology   roadmap   for  their  organization   (CDW             LLC,  2011).    Because   adopting  cloud 

computing   in   enterprise  environment   is  non-trivial,  carrying  out  long-term   planning   is 

necessary  and  can  be  done  only when  the  benefits  of cloud  computing  match  the  goals of 

the organization. 

Cloud  computing  allows  organizations  to  realize  their  strategic  objectives  by  shifting the 

focus  from  dedicating  time  and  resources  on  commodity  services  and  processes  to  their 

                                                   -34- 

----------------------- Page 36-----------------------

 core  value-generating  process,  especially  using  public  cloud  services.  Organizations  will  be 

 able   to  shift  responsibility  and  the   management  of  non-core          IT  capabilities  to  cloud 

 providers. 

 In  
    healthcare  organizations, the top goals  generally fall  between  the following  lines: 

     *   Improved  healthcare services 

     e   Standardized and  simplified  healthcare information 

     *   "Anywhere  access"  to data,  documents,  and applications 

     e   Consolidated  IT  
                            infrastructure 

     e   Compliance with  regulations and  policies 

     e   Reduced  IT  
                       capital requirements  and  operating expenses 

According   to   a  study   by    Deloitte,  the  organizations  that   successfully   adopted   cloud 

computing  did  so  mainly  because of the  clear  business case  and  the quick  realization of the 

 business  goals  (Deloitte,  2011).  The  challenge  that  needs  to  be  addressed  is to  provide 

accurate  information  on  costs  and  risks to ensure  that  decision  makers can  compare  trade- 

offs  and  make   informed  decisions   (Khajeh-Hosseini,  Greenwood,   Smith,   &  Sommerville, 

2010). 

The  business  case for  investing in  cloud  based  HIT can  be  built from  several  perspectives.  It 

must consider  both  monetized  and  non-monetized  aspect. 

    *    From  a  business  perspective,  cloud  computing  offers  the  potential  to  bring  more 

         flexibility  in  business  processes.  The  potential  to  scale  the  cloud  platform  rapidly 

        while  paying only  for the  actual  usage  provides  the  organization  with  the  possibility 

         of rapid and flexible scaling or capacity for critical business  processes. 

    *    From  a financial  perspective,  any  HIT  investment  has  immediate  purchase  costs, 

         adaptation  to the  local  organization,  and  staff training.  Because  profits  = revenue - 

         costs, all  organizations benefit from  becoming more  efficient  and  reducing the  costs 

         per  patient  (PG,   SC,   & EB,  2006).  Cloud  based  HIT  requires  less  upfront  investment 

         by   using  a  utility  billing  model   instead  of  hardware   acquisition.   It  benefits  the 

                                                -35- 

----------------------- Page 37-----------------------

    organization from  a cash  flow  point of view.  The  business  case  for  cloud  based  HIT 

    depends on  the  downstream  financial  benefits exceeding the  initial  investment  plus 

    the  on-going  fees.  An  assessment  on  the  costs  associated  with  the  use  of  cloud 

    computing  should  be  done  in comparison  with  what  is then  the  current  IT cost  to 

    support  accurate  estimation  and  informed  decision  making.  Because  the  cost  and 

    benefits  are   both   long  term,   an   NPV   calculation  should   be   used  for  return  on 

    investment. 

"   From    an   IT  perspective,   cloud  computing   enables     a  transformation     on   how 

    information  technology  is  managed   and   used.   By  using  a  combination  of  cloud 

                                     systems,  organizations  can  achieve  new  levels of agility 
    computing with traditional  IT  

    and  flexibility  allowing  to  deal  with  the  rapid  changes  that  the  current  economy 

    requires  and  to  better  support  the  business. The  disruptive  effect  cloud  computing 

    has  on  how  business  interact  with  IT, confirms  that the  business  needs  to  ensure 

                                towards  the  business,  have  a good   understanding  of  the 
    they  clearly  position  IT  

    business  needs  and  above  all,   become  true  business  partners  to  implement  and 

    execute  business strategies. 

*   From  an  employee  perspective,  cloud  computing  and  related  technologies  have  a 

    significant  impact  on  the  way  work  is performed.  Through  the  use  of  public  and 

    hybrid  clouds, data  and  application access  becomes  ubiquitous as  long as  an  internet 

    connection   is available.  This   allows  employees   to  work  from   remote   locations 

    without  much trouble  getting access to their data  and  applications. 

"   From  an  organizational  perspective,  the  adoption  of cloud  computing  in   IT, Sales, 

    and  HR  is apparent  in  healthcare,  but for the  core  business  applications  (e.g.  EHR, 

    etc.),  there  is still  a lot of  room  to  grow.  With  cloud  computing,  responsibilities  of 

    each  department  may  change  or  shift  with  the  proposed  system.  New  groups  may 

    be  added and  old  groups  may  be dissolved.  Operational feasibility should  be  studied 

    to   clarify  responsibilities  and  strategic  dependencies   among   organizations   and 

    departments  with  the  cloud  adoption.   Even   if  the  change  is small,   it  helps  the 

    decision  making.

     4.2       Regulation  & Policy 

      Health  care  is a highly regulated  industry, so  is health  information  technology.  In order  to 

     successfully adopt  cloud  computing, one  must  make sure  the  solution complies  and  provide 

      means  to  comply  with  all   related   regulations,  policies  and   standards.  "What  does  the 

      regulation  and   policy  landscape  look   like?"   becomes   an   imminent   question  for  every 

     healthcare  entity.  Without  clear  understanding  of  the  landscape,  one   may  end  up  with 

     unrealistic  estimation  on  the  complexity  of  the  solution.  With  full  understanding  of the 

     regulation  and  policy  landscape,  it  set  a good  starting  point  for  selecting  the  right  set  of 

     cloud candidates. 

     Government   stimulation   plans           also   play  very     important   roles   in     promoting   modern 

     computing  system  adoptions  in  health  care.  Many  organizations  are   passive  rather  than 

     proactive  in terms  of taking  on  new  rules  and  adapting  to  new  requirements.  But  when 

     there  is a stimulation  plan  enacted  most  organizations change  their  behaviors. A clear and 

     correct  interpretation  of  these  plans  are  sometimes  difficult  to  achieve,  but  is critical  to 

     have. 

     Furthermore,  regulations  and  policies develop  and  evolve  over time,  especially when  there 

     is a change in  administration  of the government.  It also  makes  sense to take  a moment  and 

     think about what  impact it might have on your cloud  adoption  plan. 

     In  section   2.2  we     reviewed   the  history  of  the  development   of  HIT   and   the   related 

     regulations.  The  recent  enactment  of  laws  and   regulations  is  reshaping  the  healthcare 

     system.   HHS   has  the  authority  to  promulgate  regulations  and  guidance  to  support  the 

     development   of  a  nationwide  HIT   infrastructure.  The   HHS  website  has  a  list  of  current 

     regulations  and   guidance6 . The   Centers  for   Medicare   &  Medicaid  Services   (CMS)                    also

 business  practices  and  in  compliance  with  applicable  laws  in  an   ethical  manner,  and  to 

avoid   costly  litigation.  The   HIPAA   and   HITECH          laws  spell   out  the  minimum         necessary 

standards  of  protection  on  privacy  and  security  and  set  forth  the  expectation  that  the 

organization   continually  evaluate  the  adequacy   and   effectiveness  of  their  information 

 protection  controls.  An  organization  that  fails  to  comply  with  HIPAA  can  face  fines  up  to 

$50,000 per violation. The  breach  notification  requirement  of the  HITECH  Act  explicitly state 

the  legislative  intention to create an  incentive on  all  covered  entities to secure and  protect 

 PHI  or suffer financially. These  impose  big information  security  risks on  healthcare  providers 

and   HIT  vendors.  While  the  healthcare  organizations  and   physicians  can  get   incentive 

 payments for  rapid  HIT  adoption, they also  bear the  burden  of complying with  the  intensive 

 regulatory  requirements,  which   in   some  cases  outweigh  the  monetary   benefits  of  the 

 incentive programs. 

4.3       Technology 

As   discussed  in  previous  sections,  cloud  computing  is   a  new  evolving  technology.  New 

developments,  new solutions, and  new  offerings  are  being added  quickly and  quietly.  Even 

just   in   the  health   care     industry,   more   and      more   vendors   and   developers  join   the 

 marketplace every day. As  an  integral part of the  framework,  the  purpose of the technology 

study  is  to  understand  the  characteristics  of cloud  computing  development  in  healthcare 

and  seek the  suitability of the  candidate solution. 

 For example,  Amazon  recently announced  its  HIPAA compliant cloud  providing services,  and 

claimed  that  "healthcare  businesses  subject to  HIPAA  can  utilize the  secure,  scalable,  low- 

cost,  IT  infrastructure  provided  by Amazon  Web  Services  (AWS)  as  part  of building  HIPAA- 

compliant  applications."  Amazon  does  it  through  data  encryption  and  a  set  of  security 

policies  and   processes  controls.  However,  according  to  many  experts  in  the  field,  the

    Amazon  AWS  is  not exactly HIPAA  compliant,  e.g.  there  is  no  customer  accessible  AWS  API 

     call  audit  log; there  is  no way  to  restrict the  source  IP address from  which  the AWS  API  key 

     can  be  used;  each  AWS   account   is limited  to  a  single   key,  which   evokes  unauthorized

                                      can  leverage the  well  developed  virtualization  technologies for  other  IT 
                                      offerings. We  rate  it at  10 since  there  is  no  known  barrier for transferring 
                                      to cloud computing for  HIT.

                                      providers  and   HIT  vendors.  We  give   it  a  5  as  the  safety  and  security

4.4      Implementation 

After the  strategic alignment, the  study of regulations  and  policies, and the selection  of the 

                                                                                                     always 
technology, we  can then  proceed to the next step  and focus  on  implementation.  It is  

a good  idea to  think of the  flow  of  information  and  come  up  with  an  implementation  plan 

that  met the organizational  needs. 

For  any  cloud computing  adoption  project, the first challenge  is to seamlessly  integrate  the 

cloud  deployment  with  the  organization's  existing  IT infrastructure.  One  of the  important 

roles  of  IT is  ensuring  proper  data   integration   between   applications  and   systems  and 

preventing  incompatible solutions to  be  acquired  and  implemented.  When  an  organization 

fails to  implement  proper data  integration  between  clouds and  other  legacy solutions, there 

is the  risk of creating  "departmental  data  silos". Transferring  data from  one  cloud service to 

 another is not an  easy process and  it  leads to sharing deficiencies. 

                                             department  needs to  play  during the  implementation. 
We  should  consider what  role the  IT  

As  it  becomes  ever  easier  to  implement  applications  using  cloud  computing,  IT might  be 

 excluded   from     implementing      IT  solutions  in   the   organization   (Chorafas,     2010).   It  is 

                                                                    resource.  Especially Software-as-a- 
 especially valid  in  organizations where  there  is limited  IT  

 Service  solutions allow for  easy and straightforward  implementation,  as  in  most  cases these 

 solutions  need   no  specific   IT assistance  with   regards  to  installation,  configuration  and 

                                                                                       in  the first  place to 
 deployment.  On  the  other  side,  when  IT is involved, this  involvement  is

                       provides  proper application support. 
 systems or that  IT  

 We  should  also  consider  what  type  of cloud  to  implement.  Private  clouds  are  popular  in 

 large   enterprises  because  they  give   business  the  most  direct  control  and  the  greatest 

 confidence  in  data  security  and  information  assurance.  Public  clouds  are  easy  to get  on  or 

 off. Sometimes,  hybrid  might the  best solution. As  organizations become  more  comfortable 

 with  cloud  computing,  they will  increasingly  seek to  capitalize on  the  different  advantages 

 of each  cloud type and  related  architectural  models.

     Last  but  not  least, we  should  identify  roadblocks and  develop  a mitigation  plan  to ensure  a 

     smooth  implementation.  For  many  hospitals with  large  legacy  systems,  from  mainframes to 

     databases  and   local   network,  they  usually  have  very   large   programming   libraries  with 

     extensions and  patches, that were  typically written ten,  twenty, or  more years  ago.  Many of 

     these  programs  are  mission  critical  and  cannot  be  easily  adjusted  to  provide  interfaces to 

     cloud  applications.  But  in  many cases,  the  new  cloud  base  solution  has  to  replace  or work 

     together  with  the  old   legacy  systems.  In  this  situation,  a system  re-engineering  effort  is 

     needed, which  includes data  mapping,  process  mapping, and  workflow  re-design,  and  so  on, 

     in  order  to  provide  a fully functional  cloud  solution. As  you  can  see,  this  is  not  a short  easy 

     task.  The  project  leader has to  acquire  adequate  resources,  time  and  budget to  accomplish 

     it. 

     4.5       Evaluate the "Success Factor" 

     Establishing clear and  measurable success criteria  is the  first step. This will generate  support 

     from  end  customers  and  decision  makers  within  the  enterprise.  Success  criteria  should  be

                           metrics. Although  IT metrics  are  important, functional  key performance 
    broader than just  IT  

    indicators,  executing  and  supporting  organizational  goals  (e.g.  average  length  of  patient 

    visit, customer  satisfaction  rate) will elevate the  benefits of the adoption. 

    Using  measurable  and  quantifiable  dimensions  of  parameters  can   make  meaningful  and 

    reliable comparison  among  projects, or different  solutions for the  projects. The  quantifiable 

    parameters for  hospitals and  physicians can  be  developed  from  the following  areas:  Quality, 

    Process    Improvement,      Financial,  and   Customer    Satisfaction,   to  show    the   business 

    performance  comparison  before  and  after the  project  implementation.  Many  organizations 

    have  defined their own  key  performance  indicators  (KPIs)  to  measure the  business health of 

    the   organization   and   ensure   that   all   employees   at  all  levels   are  in  sync   with   the 

    organizational  goals  and  strategies.  These  KPIs  should  be  considered  as  a source  for  the 

    success  factors  to  measure  the  project  output  as  well. As  discussed  at the  beginning  of the 

    framework,   the   key  for  a  successful   cloud   computing   adoption      is  to  align  with   the 

    organization's goal  and  overall  strategy. The  definition of the  success factors  needs to  show 

    that  in a quantified way. 

5.  EHR  - A  Case  Study 

After  the  ARRA   simulation  plan,   many  IT vendors  started  to  develop,  test,  and   implement 

systems  that  provide  meaningful  use  of  EHRs.  Cloud  computing  is also  one  of the  solutions.  A 

case  study  on  cloud  computing  for  EHR  is  used  to  evaluate the  framework  and  show  that the 

readiness of cloud adoption  in  EHR  systems. 

                                                                                                 essence, 
To  set the stage,  we  will  use  PTSO  of Washington  (PTSO)  as the subject of the  study.  In  

PTSO    is  a   Health  Center   Controlled    Network    (HCCN)    providing   centralized    healthcare 

information  systems  to  multiple  Community  Health  Centers  (CHCs).   PTSO   provisions  software 

development, application  management, technological  infrastructure,  project management,  and 

ongoing support services for  clinical care  delivery and  patient  management  systems.  They  have 

centralized  database  storage  that  hosts  the  data  warehouse  for  all  healthcare  centers  under 

their membership. They also  provide some  data center  management  services such  as disk racks, 

                                                   -44-

 real-time   replica  systems,  disaster  recovery  systems,  etc.   PTSO   is incorporated   in  2004   in 

 Seattle,  WA  and  has  eight  (8)  CHC                       members  and  over  55   clinic  sites.  In 2011,  there  were 

 approximately  335  providers,  140,000  patients  using  PTSO   network  which   had  over  550,000 

 annual encounters. 

 The  previous  President  of  the  United  States,  G.W.  Bush,  set  the  goal  for  most  Americans  to 

 have  EHR  by 2014  (White  House  Executive Order,  2004).  According to the  National Ambulatory 

 Medical  Care  Survey  (NAMCS)  done  by the  National  Center for  Health  Statistics (NCHS)   in  2011 

 on    patient  visits  to  office-based   physicians  that  collects   information  on                                          use  of  EHR/EMR 

 systems  has  shown that the adoption  of EMR/EHR  systems  has  increased  (Figure  8).

The  number suggested  that the pace  of adoption  of EHR  is quickening. If PTSO  is going to adapt 

to a new  EHR  system,  how  should  they  start  their  evaluation?  Is cloud  computing  a suitable 

technology?  If so,  how  and  what  does  it  cost  to  implement  a successful  solution?  Using the 

framework developed above, we  hope to  help PTSO  to  make  a clear and confident decision. 

                                                                          -45-

 When  PTSO  considers the adoption  of a  
                                               new EHR system,  the first step  is to evaluate the  overall 

 alignment  of strategy  and  corporate  goals  (as  shown  in  Figure  7).  As  stated on  PTSO's website, 

 PTSO's  vision  is to  become  "the  technology  services  partner  of choice to  enhance  community 

 health  center  business  processes  and  improve  community  health."  The  mission of PTSO  is:  "To 

 work   in  partnership  with   CHCs     to   improve   patient  care   through   shared,    cost   effective 

technology and  services."9 Adopting  cost  effective technology to  improve  patient care  is one  of 

 PTSO's  organizational  strategies.  Cloud  based  EHR  as  one  of the  fast  developing  technologies 

 has  received  much  attention from the  IT and  HIT industries. So  the  question to  be answered  is, 

 "does  the adoption  of a cloud  based  EHR  system  align with  PTSO's  goals  and strategy? 

A  systematic  review on  the  impact  of HIT on  quality,  efficiency, and  costs  of medical  care  (Wu, 

 et  al.,  2006)  concluded that the  benchmark  institutions have  demonstrated  the efficacy of  HIT 

 in   improving  quality  and  efficiency.  An   updated  review  as  a continuum  of  the  above  study 

 (Goldzweig, Towfigh,  Maglione,  & Shekelle,  2009)  confirmed  the  previous conclusion,  and  also 

 indicated   the   paucity   of   quantitative   cost-benefit   data    and   calculation   of   actual   HIT 

 implementation. 

Southern   California   Evidence-based   Practice   Center  (EPC)     has   provided  an   evidence-based 

 practice   report  on   the   costs  and  benefits  of  HIT   systems,  along  with   an   accompanying 

interactive database that catalogs and  assesses the  existing evidence  (PG,  SC,   & EB,  2006).  This 

report  systematically  reviews  the  literature  on  the  implementation  of  HIT  systems  in  all  care 

settings  and  assesses  the  evidence  in  specific circumstances,  such  as  the  costs  and  benefits of 

HIT  for  pediatric  care,  the  costs  and  cost-effectiveness of  implementing  EHR,  and  so  on.  The 

result  of this study showed  that, EHRs  were  associated  with improvements  in service and other

resource    utilization,  provider  productivity,   care     efficiency,  documentation      quality,  clinical 

decision-making, guideline compliance, and costs of care. 

Apparently,  the  studies  confirm  that,  in  general,   implementing  an         EHR  system   aligns  with 

PTSO's  organizational  goal  of improving  patient care.  However, the  literature  also  indicated that 

building  a  business  case  using  quantitative  cost-benefit  models  is  still  in  early  development 

stages. There  is  a lack of meaningful  data to calculate and  show  numerical financial benefits and 

gains. 

In  this  case  we  will  discuss  the  business  case  of cost-benefit  of  adopting  a cloud  based  EHR 

system at  PTSO  in qualitative senses: 

    e    From  a  business  perspective:  as  a  membership  organization,  one  of  PTSO's  tasks  is  to 

         help  its  members to  be  more  efficient  and  effective at their  business  processes through 

        training,  education,  and  new technology adoption.  Information  and  knowledge  sharing 

         on  business  processes  across  members  of  PTSO  can  be  achieved  by  using  cloud  based 

         EHR  systems.  When  there are  other  HCCN  or similar  organizations using the same  cloud, 

        sharing data  or function across  multiple organizations  is  also  possible. Cloud  based  EHRs 

        are  generally  developed  to  scale  and  to  serve  a greater  base  of clients,  therefore  they 

        provide  a  powerful  platform  for  the  clients  to  share  best  practices  on  their  business 

        processes. 

    *   From  a  financial  perspective,  implementation  of  an   EHR   system   requires  substantial 

        capital  investments,  especially  at  the  beginning  of the  learning  curve  for  training  and 

        loss   of   productivity.   However  comparing   to   conventional         EHRs,   the   cloud   based 

        solutions  not only  improve workflow  and  reduce paperwork,  but also  reduce the cost  of 

        infrastructure and space  usage,  as well as  the need  of hiring more employees to  manage 

        and   maintain  on-premise   systems        (Kundra,   2010).   Software   upgrades  and   ongoing 

        support  can  be  outsourced  to  the  cloud  vendors.  All  of these  provide  necessary  cost 

        savings  for PTSO  to stay flexible  and  cost competitive  in  financial  needs. 

    "   From  an   IT  perspective,  migrating  to  cloud-based  EHRs  will  free  up  the  IT  resources 

        devoted   to   functions  such      as  network   administration,   system       maintenance,   and 

                                                     -47-

        hardware  support,  etc.  Those  resources  can  be  released  or  reallocated  to  user-facing 

        support or  business analysis to  improve  business operations.  For example, they can  stay 

        focused  on  EHR   usages,  such  as  who  are  using  EHR  services,  which  departments  are 

                                                                                           group  will  get  a 
        most  frequently  users,  and  other  usage  patterns.  By  doing  so,  the  IT  

        better understanding of the  business, and  improve  its services  accordingly as  an  integral 

        part  of  the  business,  and  then  ultimately  becomes  a  stronger  force   in  driving  the 

        business  using  appropriate  information  technology  (Thompson,  Osberoff,  Classen,   & 

        Sitting, 2009). 

    *   From  an  employee  perspective, an  easy-to-use  cloud  based  EHR  system  not only makes 

        their jobs  easier,  but  also   makes  their  skills  transferable  when  they  move  from  one 

        organization  to  another.  As   discussed  in  section  2.1,  cloud  computing  becomes  more 

        and   more   popular  in   most   industries  or  areas.  The   skills  developed   in   cloud   EHR 

        adoption  by  PTSO  employees  are  applicable  to  other  types  of  cloud  adoptions.  Either 

        another  type  of cloud,  or  the  same  cloud  in  another  organization,  directly  or  indirectly 

        adopting  a cloud  based  EHR  improves the  competencies  and  competitiveness  of  PTSO's 

                            job  market. 
        employees in  the  

    "   From  an  organizational  perspective, implementation  of an  EHR  system  typically requires 

        significant  organizational  change,  as  new  procedures  and  business  practices  have to  be 

        adopted  in  order to  meet the  EHR  collecting  and  storing  rules  and  regulations. A cloud 

         based  EHR  system  unifies these  procedures  and  business  practices  among  members  of 

         PTSO,   at  the  same  time  also  connects  PTSO   with  others  who   use  the  same   cloud. 

        Although  the  same  organizational  change  is required  for  both  cloud  based   EHR  and 

         conventional      EHR,   a   cloud-based      solution    provides     more    opportunities      for 

         benchmarking with similar organizations. 

In summary,  EHR  systems  are  essential for  improving efficiency  and  quality of health care,  and 

cloud  computing  makes  it  easier  and  less  expensive,  both  of which  align  with  PTSO's  overall 

goals  and  strategies.  A qualitative  analysis on  the  business  case  of adopting  a cloud  base  EHR 

also  shows  multiple  benefits in  all  perspectives. Thus,  we  conclude the  adoption of cloud  based 

EHR  is strategically sound  and  beneficial to PTSO  in  the  long run.

             I  Policy  

 Next, we  need to  look at the regulations and  policies. 

 HIT  is  heavily regulated  due  to the  sensitivity and  privacy  rules  of health  information.  EHR  as  a 

 major component of HIT  not only  has to obey the  laws  enacted to overall  HIT  systems,  but also 

 has to follow the specific regulations and  standards  regarding EHR. 

 From  the Table  3  we  can  see  that  in  order to  be qualified  as  an  acceptable  EHR,  it has to  meet 

 many specific  rules and  requirements. The  legal  landscape is very complicated.  The government 

 stimulation  plan  is  provided,  but  requires substantial work  to demonstrate  "meaningful  use"  of 

 certified  EHR  technology.  Incentive  payments  are  conditioned  on  the  ability  of  providers  to 

 demonstrate   "meaningful   use"   of  EHRs,   defined   by  the  statute  as  (1)  use  of  certified  EHR 

technology  in  a demonstrably  meaningful  manner,  including  e-prescribing;  (2)  use  of certified 

 EHR  technology  that  allows  for  the  electronic  exchange  of  health  information  to  improve  the 

quality  of healthcare,  such  as  promoting  care  coordination;  and  (3)  reporting on  clinical quality 

 measures  and  other  measures  selected  by the  Secretary  using certified  EHR technology  (ARRA, 

2010). 

HITECH      employs  both  "carrots"   and  "sticks"  to  encourage  the  adoption  and  use  of  EHRs.   It 

provides  monetary  incentives to  eligible  healthcare  providers  under  Medicare  and  Medicaid, 

and  also  threatens  financial  penalties  in  the  form   of  reduced   Medicare  payments  for  non- 

adopters.  Table  7  and  Table  8  show  the  details  and  schedule  of the  incentive  payments from 

Medicare  and  Medicaid  (Goldstein, 2010).  Starting from  2011,  physicians and  hospitals who  can 

demonstrate  meaningful  use  of a certified  EHR  system  can  receive  bonus  Medicare  payments 

for  up to  five years.   Starting  in  2015,  physicians  and  hospitals that are  not  meaningfully  using 

EHRs will be  penalized in the form  of reduced Medicare fees.

 HITECH  also  gives  an  explicit  boost to state  funding  efforts for  HIT  under  Medicaid  by  providing 

a  100% federal  contribution  to  enable  EHR  adoption  by  Medicaid  providers who  serve  a  high 

volume  of  Medicaid   patients.  In   order  to  qualify  for  the  Medicaid   incentive   payment,  a 

 provider's  patient load  must  be at  least 30% Medicaid. While  the  HHS  is  obligated to  implement

 In   addition  to  the  incentive  programs,   HITECH             also  significantly  revised  the  HIPAA  law  and 

 established  the  national  data  security  breach  notification  law  for the  first  time  by  requiring 

 covered  entities  to  notify individuals whose  unsecured  PHI  has  been  disclosed  as  a  result of a 

 privacy  or  security  breach.  This   law  is   not   limited  to  breaches  of  the  security  of  online 

 information  or  restricted to  financially sensitive  information,  such  as  Social  Security  numbers. 

 The  statue applies similar  breach  notification  requirements to vendors of PHRs  (Personal  Health 

 Records),  businesses  that  offer  products or services through  the Web  site of a PHR  vendor  or  a 

                                                              -50-

covered  entity that offers  PHRs  and  entities that access  information  in or send  information  to a 

 PHR  (ARRA,  2010). 

ARRA's   HITECH     provisions  reflect  a shared  conviction  among  the  presidential  administration, 

Congress,  and   many  healthcare  experts  that  electronic  information  exchange  is essential  to 

improving   health  and      healthcare.   However,   HIT   as     a  means   of  improving  the   quality  of 

healthcare  and  the  efficiency  of  healthcare  systems,  still  faces  a  number  of  implementation 

challenges.     First  of  all,  to   support   the   new   set   of  complex      statutory   and    regulatory 

requirements  for  the  incentive  programs,  technical  and  financial  assistance  for  providers  and 

federal  and  state  agencies  are  required.  Furthermore,  these  requirements will  require  changes 

in  workflow   processes  and   systems  that  will  take  resources   and  time   to  implement  and 

upgrade. 

When  there  is an  administration  change  (e.g.  2012  selection),  there  generally  will  be  some 

directional  change  in  the  regulatory  rules.  It  usually takes  a great  amount  of time  for this type 

of directional  change to  become  fully  understood  and  enforced.  Since  most  of these  rules  are 

long term  (count in  years),  while  the  decision for  an  EHR  adoption  project  is short term  (count 

in   months),  the  direct  impact  of  administration  change  on  a specific  project  would   not  be 

dramatic.  Nonetheless, the  implementation  of EHR  adoption  projects may take years,  including 

customization,  workflow   redesign,   and   sometimes   changing  vendors   several   times.                 The 

organization     should    monitor   the   situation   and     adjust   long-term     organization    strategies 

accordingly. 

We  have  discussed  the  effect  of government  stimulation  on  the  technology  adoption  curve  in 

section  3.3.   During  the  technology  evaluation   and   implementation,   all  of  these  rules  and 

requirements  have to  be  carefully  considered  and  evaluated.  They  should  be  treated  as  a part 

of the  requirement  analysis before the  design and  development  starts.

Organizations  need  to  be  savvy  on  technology  selection.  There  are  a lot  of potential  systems 

offered  by  various  vendors.  A   recent  search   on   ONC-ATCB                certified   EHRs    returned   1132

 For  PTSO,  a cloud  based  EHR  is a suitable technology because of the following  reasons: 

     *    There  are  a number  of cloud  based  ONC-ATCB  certified  EHR  solutions  available,  which 

          indicates  that  cloud  computing  technology  has  passed  the  initial hurdle  of developing 

          commercial  EHR clouds that are  HIPAA and  "Meaningful-use"  compliant. 

     *     PTSO  as  an  HCCN  organization  puts  a lot value  on  scalability of the  system.  Both  scale 

          up  and  scale  down  are  needed  as  new  member joins  PTSO  or  existing  member  leaves 

          PTSO.   A  cloud   based   EHR   offers  PTSO   the  maximum  flexibility  with   minimum  cost 

          among the three  models.  For example, they  can add  or  remove  storage  with Amazon  or 

          Google cloud  at  any  time  and  only  pay for the  usage  incurred.  But  with  a conventional 

          implementation,   they   have  to   buy  extra           storage   space   upfront,   and       it  is  nearly 

          impossible to get  rid of excess storage without financial  penalty.

----------------------- Page 54-----------------------

     *    PTSO  covers  a large  base  of locations  (55  clinic sites).  A cloud  based  EHR  provides  the 

          best  accessibility  and  collaboration  as  users  are  able  to  securely  log  in  to  the  system 

          from  anywhere  at  any time  as  long as  they  have an  internet  connection. To  be  certified 

          by  ONC-ATCB,   the  cloud   based   EHRs   need  to  demonstrate   adequate  assurance  on 

          privacy and  security in a  
                                         widely  open  environment  (the Internet) to  meet the  HIPAA and 

          HITECH    Privacy  Rules.  This  locational  transparency  where  data  can  be  requested  and 

          produced  without   regard  to  data   location  and  without  worrying  about  privacy  and 

          access  control  is very  important  to  PTSO.           The   increasing  trend  of  cloud  computing 

          adoption  in  other  industries  has  been  clearly  evidenced  in  many  surveys  and  studies 

          (CDW  LLC,  2011)  (Deloitte,  2011).  Even  though  health  care  industry  has  lagged  behind, 

         the  same  trend  is also  shown  in  the  referenced  surveys.  Adopting  a cloud  based  EHR 

          solution  fits  into  the  overall   industry  trend  and  will  prepare   PTSO   well   for  future 

          development. 

     "   Among  the   1132   ONC-ATCB            certified  ambulatory  and   549   impatient  EHR   systems, 

          approximately  10%  of them  are  cloud-based  solutions.  PTSO   has  the  opportunity  to 

          choose from  an  abundant  resource  and find the solution  meets  PTSO's  requirements. 

     *   While  safety  and  security  of clouds  still  remain  as  a primary  concern  for  many  health 

          care  professionals, we  should  trust that the  ONC-ATCB  certified  cloud  based  EHRs  meet 

         the  security  and  privacy  rules  set  forth  by  HIPAA  and  HITECH.   The  Computer  Security 

          Division  of  NIST     has   provided   "guidelines  on   security  and          privacy  in   public  cloud 

         computing"  (NIST,  2011)  . Following the guidelines  carefully will  further  eliminate those 

         concerns that PTSO  may  have. 

Table   10  shows  a  partial   list  of  ONC-ATCB          certified  cloud   based   EHR       solutions'0  and  the 

companies  who  offer  them.  Since  PTSO             is a central  network  providing  IT solutions  to  all  its 

members,  it  has  better  information  technology  resources  and  expertise  than  a general  health 

center.  PTSO      also   has  the  capability  of  developing  its  own          IT applications  and   solutions. 

Therefore,  PaaS  seems  to  be  a better choice  as  it  provides  customer  application  development 

capability.  However,  in  the  EHR  case,  as  we  can  see  from  the  following  table,  most  of these

solutions  are  offered  as  SaaS  model,  with  only one  PaaS  model.  It  leads us  to  believe that  PaaS 

for  EHR  is still  in very  early stage of development.  Even though  PTSO  is pioneer in  adopting  new 

 IT technologies,   it  also   has   responsibility  in   ensuring  the  reliability  and   robustness  of  its 

solutions.   Using  the  factor   matrix  developed   in  section  4.3,  we   believe  the  best  suitable 

technology for  PTSO  at this time  is a SaaS  cloud  model,  since  it is so far the  most  mature  model 

in the  HIT cloud  computing  market (Table  5) and  in the  cloud-based  EHR  offerings.

 Implementing  an  EHR  solution  can  be  a tedious task  for an  organization  that  has  other similar 

systems  or  processes  in  place.  Many  research  organizations  and  consulting  firms  have  done  a 

lot of prep work to ease and  guide the  transition.  For  example,  the  Healthcare  Information  and 

Management           Systems  Society   (HIMSS)          developed   and         published   an      exhaustive   checklist 

focusing  on  the  workflow,  operations,  and  communications  factors  in  an   EHR  implementation 

process. The  full  report  is attached  (Appendix  1) and  can  serve  as  a great  reference  for  anyone 

who  is seeking to transition to  EHR. 

 In order  to  make the  checklist suitable for a cloud  EHR  implementation, we just  need  to further 

advance the  HIMSS  checklist for cloud  adoption  purpose.  The  HIMSS  checklist  is a 40-page  long 

document.  Most  of the  checklist  items  are  applicable  to  any  type  of  EHR   system  adoptions, 

including  clouds.  With  just  a few  more  add-ons  specific  for  a cloud  computing  solution,  the 

checklist will  be ready to go.

Table  11  PTSO  Cloud  EHR  Implementation  Checklist 

While  the  actual   implementation  is           not  a  focus  of  this  thesis,  one  should   know  that  the 

implementation  of  the  selected  system  takes  more  than  just  check  the  checkbox.  A  HITECH 

survey on  EHR  implementation  shows that  collaboration  and  information  gathering from  peers 

is critical to the  implementation  process, and workflow  training and  change  in  management  are 

the  two  greatest  challenges  for  EHR  adoption  (Carol,  2010).   Here  we  attempt  to  provide  a 

guideline  built upon the  lessons  learned  from  other organizations  so  the  same  mistakes can  be 

 avoided for  PTSO.

As  stated  by  HSRA,  HCCNs  as  business  entities  are  also  formed  to  exchange  information  and 

 establish  collaborative  mechanisms  to  meet  administrative,  IT and  clinical  quality  objectives. 

 PTSO  as  one  of the  HCCNs  must carry  the  same  set  of objectives.  The  adoption  of EHR  cloud 

should  also  support  PTSO   in  achieving  these  objectives.  Therefore,  the  success  factors  of the 

 adoption  shall  include  measureable  performance  parameters  in  various  areas,  such  as  quality 

 improvement,  process  (operation)  improvement,  financial  benefits,  customer  satisfaction,  and 

so on,  to support the organization  objectives. 

As  the final  step  of the framework,  we  should  investigate  what  criteria  to  use  as  indications of 

the  successfulness of the  EHR  cloud  adoption. Table  12 shows the  chosen  parameter for  PTSO 

and the  desired trend  of after the EHR  cloud  adoption.

It  is important  to  establish  the  measurement  method  of these  parameters  at  early  stage  to 

ensure   necessary   processes   and   data  points   are  being   defined   and   collected.   (National 

Committee  for  Quality  Health  Care,   2006),   (The  Society  of  Hospital  Medicine's  Benchmarks 

Committee,  2006),  and  (Shih  & Schoenbaum,   2007),  have  provided  details  and  guidelines  on 

the  metrics  and  quantification  methods  to  measure  the  hospital  performance.  We  will  not 

discuss the data  collection  and  calculation of these parameters  here,  but referring to the above 

documents  is highly recommended  when  implementing the  metrics.

6.  Conclusions 

Health  care organizations  are  rapidly developing their  HIT systems,  but they are  still at the  start 

of  a transition  period  and  face   many  challenges  with  respect  to  cloud  computing  adoption. 

There  are  currently  no  mature  techniques  or  frameworks  available  to  address  the  identified 

challenges. This thesis is  an  attempt to  provide a framework to support  decision-making  during 

the cloud  adoption for health care organizations. 

The  value  of the  framework  is  demonstrated  using  a case  study  that  focused  on  adoption  of 

cloud  based  EHR  systems  in  an  HCCN   organization.  The  study  showed  that the  framework  is 

effective  in  identifying the outstanding  issues and  providing  guidelines  in  solving these  issues 

specific  to  the  case.      Based   on   the   results  of  the  analysis   using  the  framework,              it  was 

recommended  that  adopting  EHR  cloud  at  PTSO  fits  its overall  strategy  and  is  supported  by the 

business  case;  there  are  multiple choices  of ONC-ATCB  certified  cloud  based  EHRs  meeting the 

regulations   and   standards        set  forth   by   the  government;   cloud         based     EHR    is   a  suitable 

technology  for   PTSO;        and    by  following  the  implementation            recommendations          using  the 

comprehensive  checklist, the  success  of the  adoption  can  be  reflected  in  the  measurements  of 

the  key performance  parameters  of the  HCCN  organization.
